# Electrochemical Cell Simulation


This project simulates an electrochemical cell (Volta Cell) using CreateJS. Users can drag and drop electrodes to designated positions to observe the corresponding voltmeter readings and animations.

## Features
- Drag-and-drop functionality for electrodes.
- Real-time voltmeter updates based on electrode placement.
- Looping animations for electron flow and voltmeter.
- Reset button to restore the initial state of the simulation.

## How to Use
1. Open the project in a browser.
2. Drag an electrode to the designated area.
3. Observe the voltmeter reading and animations.
4. Use the reset button to restart the simulation.

## File Structure
- **index.js**: Main JavaScript file containing the logic for the simulation.
- **images/**: Contains assets used in the simulation.
- **README.md**: Documentation for the project.

## Requirements
- A modern browser with JavaScript enabled.
- CreateJS library.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Open the project directory:
   ```bash
